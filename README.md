# Mock Yoga Payment Batch Form

This is a simple application that takes basic user details and gives the option to select the timings of the batch for the current month and pay for it. The user cannot
pay again for the same month.

Validation have been added to the form to get the required fields as well as other forms such as age restriction.

The Tech stack used is MERN stack. React is being used for frontend, nodejs for backend with express framework and MongoDB database for storing all the details.
